# Sorting Algorithms Benchmark

This project contains implementations of **9 different sorting algorithms** in Python, along with benchmarking and visualization of their performance.

## Included Algorithms

- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Counting Sort
- Radix Sort
- Bucket Sort

## Features

- Modular implementation of each sorting algorithm.
- Benchmarking of all algorithms using randomly generated lists.
- Visual comparison using `matplotlib`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- matplotlib

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

## How to Run

To benchmark and visualize the performance of sorting algorithms, simply run:

```bash
python algo_assignment_full.py
```

This will:
- Generate lists of various sizes.
- Run each algorithm on the lists.
- Plot the execution time of each algorithm.

## Output

A line plot comparing the performance of different sorting algorithms on varying input sizes.
