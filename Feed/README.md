# Social Media Feed (C++ Linked List Project)

This project is a C++ implementation of a simplified social media feed system using a singly linked list. It was developed for **CS2001 – Data Structures Assignment 01 (Fall 2023)** to demonstrate practical use of dynamic memory and data organization using linked lists.

---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ **Add Post**  
  Auto-generates a unique ID and timestamp, and inserts the post in correct chronological order.

- ✏️ **Edit Post**  
  Finds a post by ID, updates its text and timestamp, and repositions it in the list based on updated time.

- 🔍 **Search by Text**  
  Scans each post’s text and displays matches using standard string search.

- ❌ **Delete Post**  
  Removes a post by ID while maintaining list integrity.

- 📃 **Display Posts**  
  - **Oldest First**: Traverses list head to tail.
  - **Newest First**: Uses recursion to reverse display.

## 🧠 Approach

### 🔗 Linked List Design

- Each post is a node in a singly linked list.
- The list is **sorted chronologically** (ascending) based on timestamps.
- No use of STL containers — manual pointer handling for learning purposes.

### 📌 Unique ID Generation

- IDs are generated by counting nodes in the list (`getID()` function).
- Ensures IDs are sequential and unique as long as no duplicates are manually added.

### 🕒 Time Handling

- Uses `std::chrono::system_clock` to get the current system time.
- `ctime()` is used for human-readable formatting when displaying timestamps.

### ✏️ Post Editing

- After editing, the post’s timestamp is updated.
- Post is automatically repositioned based on new time value.

### 🔍 Search Operation

- Simple substring search using `string::find`.
- Linear traversal — time complexity O(n).

### 📤 Reverse Display

- Implemented using **recursion**.
- Displays the most recent post first by reaching the tail and printing during stack unwinding.

## 🧪 Example Commands

```bash
1. Add a post
2. Edit a post
3. Search for posts by text
4. Delete a post
5. Display all posts (latest first)
6. Display all posts (oldest first)
7. Exit the program
```
