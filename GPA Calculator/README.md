# ðŸŽ“ GPA Calculator (Python CLI Tool)

This is a simple Python command-line tool for calculating your GPA based on course grades and credit hours.

---

- Calculates and displays the weighted average GPA
- Simple command-line interface for quick use

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. The user is prompted to input the **GPA for a course**.
2. If the input is valid (between 0 and 4), the user is then prompted to enter **credit hours** for that course.
3. The user repeats this for all courses.
4. When done, the user enters `5` to trigger the GPA calculation.
5. The script calculates the **weighted GPA** using the formula:

\[
\text{GPA} = \frac{\sum (\text{GPA} \times \text{Credit Hours})}{\sum \text{Credit Hours}}
\]
